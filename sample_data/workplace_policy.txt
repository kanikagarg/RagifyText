### 1. Expected Standards of Behaviour

All employees are expected to:

* Treat others with dignity, respect, fairness, and courtesy.
* Communicate professionally and constructively at all times.
* Value diversity and promote an inclusive work culture.
* Foster collaboration, teamwork, and mutual support.
* Maintain integrity and honesty in all professional interactions.
* Uphold the company's code of ethics and compliance standards.

These standards are essential to maintain a workplace that reflects ACompany’s values and legal responsibilities. Compliance with these behavioural expectations ensures that every employee can thrive in an environment free from harassment, discrimination, and conflict.

### 2. Harassment, Discrimination & Bullying

ACompany has a **zero-tolerance policy** for any form of:

* **Harassment**: Unwelcome verbal, physical, or visual conduct that creates an intimidating or hostile work environment.
* **Discrimination**: Unfair treatment based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, or any protected characteristic.
* **Bullying**: Repeated, unreasonable behaviour that degrades, intimidates, or isolates individuals.

Examples of prohibited behaviour include:

* Derogatory remarks or jokes
* Unwanted physical contact or advances
* Threats, yelling, or verbal abuse
* Cyberbullying or exclusion in online collaboration spaces
* Retaliation for reporting inappropriate conduct

Maintaining a workplace free from harassment, discrimination, and bullying is fundamental to ensuring the psychological safety and well-being of all employees. These behaviors are not only unethical, but they also undermine team cohesion, reduce productivity, and expose the company to serious legal liabilities. ACompany is committed to fostering a professional environment where everyone feels valued and supported, and any breach of this commitment will be taken seriously and addressed promptly.
